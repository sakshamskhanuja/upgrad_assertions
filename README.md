## Assertions

### Description

The program contains multiple test cases that uses different assert methods.

1. <b>assertEquals</b>: The ```assertEquals``` assertion verifies that the expected and actual values are equal.

2. <b>assertArrayEquals</b>: If we want to assert that two arrays are equal, we can use the ```assertArrayEquals``` method.

3. <b>assertNotNull</b>: ```assertNotNull``` asserts that the ```Object``` is not ```null```, and if it is ```null```, a message is shown.

4. <b>assertNull</b>: ```assertNull``` asserts that the ```Object``` is ```null```, and if it isn't ```null```, a message is shown.

5. <b>assertNotSame</b>: ```assertNotSame``` asserts that two variables don't refer the same ```Object```, if they are, a message is displayed.

6. <b>assertSame</b>: ```assertSame``` asserts that two variables refers the same ```Object```, if they are not, a message is displayed.

7. <b>assertTrue</b>: If you want to verify that a certain condition is ```true```, then we can use the ```assertTrue``` method.

8. <b>assertFalse</b>: If you want to verify that a certain condition is ```false```, then we can use the ```assertFalse``` method.

9. <b>assertThat</b>: The ```assertThat``` method checks for ```Matcher``` object in the actual value.

10. <b>assetThrows</b>: ```assertThrows``` checks whether a particular exception is thrown in a piece of code.
